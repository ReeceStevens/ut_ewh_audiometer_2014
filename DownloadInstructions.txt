New Download Instructions for the Audiometry App
------------------------------------------------

Well everyone, the switch to Android Studio has definitely paid off. 
We now can use github a LOT more easily and get this project set up 
on everyone's computers with minimal fuss. Here are the steps to
get the project up-to-date and running on your computer:

1) Download Android Studio

Just google "Android Studio Download" and you should find it within the first two results. 
The version specific to your operating system will automatically download.

2) Download this repository

Use the "clone to desktop" or git clone command to download this repository to your computer. 
Remember where you put it- you'll be coming back to it really quickly. 

3) Open Android Studio

Once android studio is up and running, you will see a startup menu. Select the "Import Project"
function and navigate to wherever you put the repository that you downloaded. Open it and 
you'll find a file called "settings.gradle". Select that file and import the project. After everything
loads, you should be up to speed with the latest  version of the project!
