Project Start Date: 1.29.14

Developers: EWH UT

This project is to create an Android app that performs as an audiometer. This project has two main sections:

  1. Proctor an audiometer test and gather user input data

  2. Analyze this data and return a verdict to the user, as well as export data in a readable format for further analysis by a doctor

We will develop the data analysis and test proctoring code in Java, and implement the user interface on the Android SDK platform.

Goals (Updated 4.13.14)
------------------------------------

Refine and develop user interface

Exporting end test result 

Calibration per output device
