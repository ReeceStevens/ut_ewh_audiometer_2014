UT Engineering World Health Audiometry App

Welcome to Audiometry Made Easy!

AME is an open source Android application designed to diagnose hearing loss without the need for 
expensive medical machines. Using signal analysis and your phone or tablet's own microphone, AME 
can calibrate virtually any pair of earphones for a hearing test that will return the user's 
hearing thresholds in dB HL. It also provides services for the user to save test results, view them
later, and email test results anywhere from within the app.

This project was originally created for the Engineering World Health 2014 Design Competition, which 
is a competition focused on designing novel solutions to issues in the medical world of developing
countries. Engineering World Health is an awesome organization, and you can find out more about them
at wwww.ewh.org. I went with EWH to Rwanda in the summer of 2014 for two months to work in local hospitals,
fix stuff, and see these problems for myself-- if you want to learn more about that, check out my blog at
reecestevens.svbtle.com. 

Even though the EWH Design Competition is over for this year, my development of this app is not! Check
it out on the Google Play Store under Audiometry Made Easy and tell me what you think. I'm dedicated 
to constantly improving this app and making it a better and better replacement for a traditional 
audiometer machine.

This code is under the MIT license, which basically means that you can use bits of this code wherever
you'd like! If you find something useful for your own project, shoot me an email at reecestevens@utexas.edu.
I'd love to see how the app is helping you! And if you're feeling generous, feel free to thank AME in your
project:)
