UT Engineering World Health Audiometry Test App
------------------------------------------------

Project Start Date: 1.29.14

Developers: EWH UT

This project is to create an Android app that performs as an audiometer. This project has two main sections:

Proctor an audiometer test and gather user input data

Analyze this data and return a verdict to the user, as well as export data in a readable format for further analysis by a doctor

We will develop the data analysis and test proctoring code in Java, and implement the user interface on the Android SDK platform.

Goals (Updated 4.13.14)

Refine and develop user interface

Exporting end test result 

Calibration per output device
